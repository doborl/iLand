see xls with standgrid codes with assigned site groups for different
stps. For site codes use column Majority - this is the most frequent
site group within each stand. The coding is simple:

1 - site type 1

2 - site type3

3 - site type5

4 - site type7a

5 - site type7b

6 - few stands for which we could not assign sites

Null - few small stands which are outside layer with sites

I suggest to replace 6 and Null by 3, which is the most frequent category.
