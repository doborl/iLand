/*
This management script is doing businness-as-usual activities on the full landscape of our study area in the Low Tatra for iLand model.

2017/08/18 - 2021/10/14

We have one agent and one unit. But have 2 stps: one for stand where beech and fir presents (in 0, or 1 layer), they go to stp2 to a shelterwood management (1b), others go to stp1 (1a) small scale clearcut.
This selection was done in preprocess (in R).

Activities that this script is doing:

Planting
Tending
Thinning max 4 times in one rotation period
Regeneration cut: in shelterwood cases
Clearcut

Salvaging: We added there salvaging in order to remove dead trees which produced in the BB module.

// Defines a fraction 0-1 of 2x2m pixels for which to plant trees of the given species. The `fraction` is interpreted as a probability, i.e. for each 2x2m pixel a random number decides whether to plant or not.
